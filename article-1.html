                                Upon entering STEM many would face difficulties, but it's not that bad. There are students in STEM that achieve something as they progress and graduate from the STEM strand. Here are some achievements that STEM students achieve by taking on the challenge of the STEM strand. 
                                <br><br>
                                For me, I observed in myself that, even though it's still not that good, being a STEM student has improved my Math and critical thinking skills. I would say that it may, and will be hard at times, but the self-growth that you will observe will be well worth it.

                                <br><br>
                                STEM helped students improve their overall performance, whether it'd be performing task, completing assignments or homeworks, conducting a research, participating in activities.
                                <br><br>
                                Visible growth in one person is achieved within STEM, due to the particular reason of the challenging subjects that will slowly improve a student thinking ability, decision making.
                                Edward Moran - G11 STEM 
                                <br><br>
                                Upon entering STEM, I was able to achieve a better version of myself. I became more eager to learn, more braver and stronger to face future challenges, and developed numerous skills and talents. Therefore, STEM shaped me into who I am today in which I am proud of.
                                Jen Reyes - G11 STEM 
                                <br><br>
                                Is one of the most well known women in the history of STEM fields. She is, so far, the only woman in the field of science to win the Nobel Prize in two separate scientific fields: physics and chemistry.
                                Marie Sk≈Çodowska Curie 
                                <br><br>
                                Microsoft co-founder that wrote his first computer software program at age 13. He also gathered a STEM-based group together by gathering programmers together who computerize their high school's payroll system.
                                Bill Gates 
                                <br><br>
                                By taking the STEM strand many personalities achieved great things. As for you who wants to take it you could achieve your goals, dreams, and personal improvement which is the main goal of taking STEM. Make yourself grow and improve by taking STEM. Now that you know what you can have, are you willing to take it?
