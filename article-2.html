                                    Students are more likely to enroll in STEM courses in college and potentially choose to work in related professions if they receive better STEM education before that point. In addition, they'll be more assured about their academic endeavors in general and far less inclined to quit.

	                                We must admit that, as Grade 11 STEM students, what we are going through right now is really different from what we were thinking while we were still in junior high school. We encountered several new acquaintances and students, all of whom had unique personalities and traits. When it comes to the activities and performance tasks that I must complete, being a STEM student makes us more patient and responsible. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    For STEM students to successfully complete their given duties, they must be very persistent and determined. They need knowledge and may result in difficulties and challenges in life, but such issues fortify us and have a significant influence on our lives as well as our academic performance. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We often say that before achieving our goals, we must go through many hardships in life. The STEM experience will be beneficial because it will allow you to learn more about the topics covered and even help you find a stable job in the future. It will also teach you the importance of helping others and the idea that we shouldn't let ourselves or those around us fall behind but rather should be the catalyst for their ascent as well.

                                    Being a STEM student takes a lot of work, perseverance, and devotion. But underneath all of this, there are a ton of special moments and adventures that add to the excitement of our Grade 11 experience.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In high school, as a STEM student, I discovered the value of projects and homework. I also developed a sense of community, learned how to apply what I had learned, and mentored other STEM students as a result of the excruciating amount of homework. Because you all work together to graduate and attend college, the STEM students have connected like bees in a hive. The coursework was occasionally very challenging, especially during my freshman year. Of course, most STEM students, including me, were under stress. For instance, in computer science, neither I nor anybody else in my class knew how to write the code for our project. I was able to finish the project because a friend who had previously taken the course was able to explain how to write the code.

                                    Due to the difficulty of our subjects and the effort required to pass them, it encourages me to study more seriously. My experience as a grade 11 student was made more difficult by certain topics, such as Statistics and Probability, General Chemistry, and Basic Calculus.

                                    It takes a lot of work, perseverance, and dedication to be a STEM student. But behind all of these, there are a ton of special moments and adventures that have made my time as a grade 11 student more interesting overall.
