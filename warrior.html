                            During my final year in junior high, choosing a strand wasn't too tough for me as I have already made up my mind to take STEM. I did so for three main reasons. First, it was aligned to what I want to pursue in the future. I have always dreamt of being a successful doctor, and taking STEM would be the best choice. Second, I was part of the STE program during my junior high times. Since I have graduated junior high school in that program, continuing it and taking STEM is recommended by my teachers. It would be a great choice as I would have prior knowledge about the possible lessons we will be taking. Lastly, my family suggested STEM if I was still unsure and undecided. STEM careers are consistently in demand, there are a variety of work options available especially in the Philippines. Hence, taking the STEM strand would be the best course of action. I know I'll face a lot of challenges in the future as a result of choosing this path. However, I've already overcome some of them so I believe I am braver and stronger now to be able to handle problems in the future. If I can accomplish it, I'm sure you can too. Take the STEM strand with me.

                            Being a former STE student, it is actually not surprising that I am taking this strand. I must admit, however, that I wasn't certain beforehand which strand I ought to pursue. But when our research teacher said before that the STE Program would become meaningless and nonsense if we did not continue on the track it offers, I realized at that point that I should choose STEM as my strand. And as I was considering what our teacher had said before, I came to the realization that the course I wanted to take in college fit into this strand, which is Engineering. My creativity and 21st-century skills were developed when I entered the STEM field. Media and technology literacy, productivity, social skills, communication, adaptability, and initiative are examples of 21st-century skills. Additionally, as we are starting face-to-face sessions again, it develop time management skills that I needed, my communication skills, and critical thinking.

                            To be honest, choosing STEM strand wasn’t my first choice. So, I did my research about this strand and looked up for the possible career and courses it offers. Some people would say that STEM strand is full of mathematical equations, endlessly solving of numbers, and logical questions. I guarantee you, it’s more than that. The experiences and moments you will have are unexplainable and will surely be part of your journey. So, why STEM? Honestly speaking, I still have no answers to that question yet. I feel like I’m still in the process of acknowledging why I am here. But I know, throughout this journey here in STEM strand I will be able to identify what my inner self seeks and wants and If I were going to give you some advice, it is okay to take your time searching for answers, because you’ll eventually find it along the process.

                            As a former STE student in junior high, I continue the journey that I've started. I'm amazed at how my studies and knowledge have been so broad since I was a junior, and it still amazes me today that I chose STEM. This strand helps me prepare myself for my next step in college; it opens my mind to mostly science and mathematics subjects. Since the path that I'm taking is in the medical field, this strand is a big advantage. I'm afraid of failing, so I strive harder for as long as I can. Work hard, then rest after. Your present self decides what your future self will be.

                            Growing up, I've always shown interest and fascination in math and science, regardless of how bad I was in those subjects. And I never once gave a thought about what I wanted to be in the future; that is, until one of my cousin shared her dreams of becoming a civil engineer and how she'll be picking the STEM strand in SHS. She explained to me how STEM was a strand for people who are aspiring to be future engineers, doctors, scientists, etc. I was inspired by her goals and decided to become an engineer in the future, as well. Fast forward -- 2 years later, here I am in STEM. A semester has passed, and this strand has certainly shaped me into a better and smarter student. The amount of challenges that STEM has thrown at me was overwhelming, but in the end, I made it. Here's what I've got to say for those who are afraid of taking this strand — don't be intimidated by the immense pressure that STEM will give you; pressure makes diamonds, after all.

                            What are my realizations as a STEM student before and during the school year?
                            When I was in 10th grade, choosing my strand was a difficult task. It was stressful knowing that my future career is quite irrelevant to the existing strands at my school. However, some people convinced me that enrolling in STEM will provide me with numerous opportunities, particularly in selecting a college major. STEM can help you develop logical and critical reasoning skills, which will help you come up with potential solutions to real-life problems. This also aids in understanding why and how things work and were created, which is one of the things that pique my curiosity in learning. The exhaustion of being a STEM student is undeniable. Despite the hardships and sacrifices that I must make, in the end, this will be a privilege for me to achieve my goals, as well as a considerable advantage for the world's future.

                            I enjoy math but am not particularly good at it, so I chose the STEM strand. You will develop an interest in it and pursue your desired career. I'm in this strand because it corresponds to a course I'd like to take in college. I like it because I like learning new and interesting things. The best advice I can give to people looking for STEM strands is to be certain about their decision because STEM is all about analysis and nothing in life is easy.

                            Because I enjoy science and technology, I chose STEM. The strand itself is in line with astronomy, which will be my future field of study and ideal career. The fact that I am also inquisitive and curious about the world makes this strand ideal for me. Students are taught to become more analytical and systematic through the STEM curriculum, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and math. Future medical professionals, engineers, and scientists tend to favor this thread. One benefit of STEM is the many job opportunities it offers to students who choose to major in STEM-related fields in college. Additionally, the topics are quite intriguing and stimulating.

                            I chose the STEM strand because I want to be a nurse someday and to be more educated and fully understand the importance of mathematics in our daily life. I want to take the risk to conquer my own flaws and eventually turn it into my strength. The other factor that urged me to choose this strand, is that I want to expand my learning about how our surroundings work according to their purposes. I am seeking accurate answers to generate better questions. In conclusion, choose this strand to learn more and do more. one of the biggest advantages of the STEM strand rests in its capacity is to set up students for success by preparing them for some of the most demanding yet fulfilling careers in society. Being a STEM student is challenging, I advise, being a STEM student is not just about being smart, it is about how determined you are in the track you've chosen. Ignore all the negative feelings and just enjoy.

                            Before I graduated from junior high school, I'm still uncertain on what track I should be taking. I've always wondered what I wanted to do because I still didn't know anything about it. But at some point STEM track occurs to me which meant a great opportunity for me. The doubts, fear and what if's are always there but once you became part of STEM family (STEMWARD) you don't feel those things anymore rather it will help you grow and teach you a lesson you'll take through out your journey in life, it will outcast your precious achievement and become the better version of you.

                            Before I started my Senior High School journey, I was hesitant which strand to choose. So, why STEM? STEM strand offers a lot of possible courses and they said it has a higher privilege if you want to enter prestigious universities but that's not what I'm after. I chose STEM because it is aligned with the future career that I want to achieve. So far, being a STEM student made me realized that this strand is more than what it seems. Despite the stressful nights, endlessly solving mathematical equations, and tiresome weekdays, it’s more than that. I’ve met amazing people with prosperous ambitions just like mine. I’ve learned a lot of things that I could apply in my life. I was anxious entering this strand because my mind is full of what ifs. What if this strand is not meant for me? What if mid-way of the semester, I end up not liking the process of learning? But I did not regret choosing this strand. As a STEM student, I advise everyone to prepare themselves to all hardcore subjects because it’s not easy as it seems especially if some of the areas of the subject is not your forte. Do some advance review of the future topics and be ready. When you’re in doubt of yourself, remember why you’re here today. Look back to all the hardships you’ve been through and how you overcome them. Because, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”

                            Before I finished grade 10, I was having a lot of trouble with the strand I was going to take, I was thinking about what I should really take, whether I should study stem or ict, so I thought and asked myself what the my passion and what are the things that make me happy and here I have decided that I should study stem because one of my passions is to give myself plenty of trouble to learn more and another since childhood I really want to math and science, that's one of the reasons why I became a stem student. It's also one of my dreams to become an electrical engineer because I also saw potential in myself in fiddling with electric things. It's also one of my passions and I'm happy. me because everything I did not expect in this strand has come true, I have been faced with many challenges and I have also learned a lot that I have wanted to know for a long time and I am Renzo Chavez Ilao who is very happy because it is an honor to share my experience in STEM.
